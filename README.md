# Trivia-Game
### How My Game Works:

* It is a trivia game where the player clicks on the Start Game button to begin playing.
* The game shows only one question till the player answers it, or runs out of time.
* The player has a limited amount of time to answer each question on the quiz.
* If the player selects the correct answer, the game congratulates him/her for choosing the right answer.  After a few seconds, the game displays the next question without any input from the player.
* If the player runs out of time, the game tells the player that time is up and shows the correct answer.  After a few seconds, the game displays the next question without any input from the player.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the game tels the player that s/he has selected the wrong answer, and then display the correct answer.  After a few seconds, the game displays the next question without any input from the player.
* At the end, the game reveals the player's score sheet: the number of questions answer correctly, incorrectly, or not at all.
* The player also has the option to try again by clicking the the Play
Again button.
